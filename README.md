# Analog Clock 

### https://analogclockproject.netlify.app/

I did this personal project using the tecnologies:

- HTML5 <img align="center" alt="HTML" height="30" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/html5/html5-original.svg">
- CSS3  <img align="center" alt="CSS" height="30" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/css3/css3-original.svg">
- Javascript   <img align="center" alt="JS" height="30" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg">

Using JS is going get your date time and calculate the degres with  (time / 60) * 360}it's will give you the degres 
of the clock's hands. 

This function it's called every second.

Furthermore, I did a light and dark mode, that will change when the user click on light bulb icon!
